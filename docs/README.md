Python is a very versatile programming language that has a wide range of
applications.  This training concentrates on interaction with the
operating system, the file system, other applications and the network.
This is useful for systems programming, but also when you want to use
Python as a coordination language for your workflows.
This training introduces modules that are useful in that context.

## Learning outcomes

When you complete this training you will

  * know how to write scripts that handle command line arguments,
    configuration files and environment variables;
  * know how to log information or errors from your applications;
  * be able to perform file system-related tasks;
  * be able to use a templating library for reporting;
  * be able to interact with processes on a Linux system;
  * be able to interact with remote systems using SSH;
  * be able to interact with compressed files.

## Training materials

Slides are available in the
 [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gjbex/Python-for-systems-programming),
as well as example code and hands-on material.


## Target audience

This training is for you if you need to use Python for scripting and
coordination of processes.


## Prerequisites

You will need experience programming in Python.  This is not a training that starts
from scratch.

If you plan to do Python programming in a Linux or HPC environment you should
be familiar with these as well.


## Levels

* Introductory: 20 %
* Intermediate: 70 %
* Advanced: 10 %


## Trainer(s)

  * Geert Jan Bex ([geertjan.bex@uhasselt.be](mailto:geertjan.bex@uhasselt.be))
